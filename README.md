 E-Commerce Company Case Study

 I extract insights from the databases to drive business strategies, enhance operations, improve customer satisfaction, and boost sales. My analysis impacts customer insights, product performance, sales optimization, and inventory management. 
 
 I used SQL to extract data from the following datasets:
- Customers customer_id, name, location
- Products:product_id, name, category, price
- Orders:order_id, order_date, customer_id, total_amount
- *OrderDetails: order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit

My work helps tailor marketing strategies, inform stock and sales decisions, identify trends, and ensure optimal stock levels.
